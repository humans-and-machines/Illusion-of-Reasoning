Problem/Clue (if available):
Four points, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle. What is the probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
The goal is to find the probability that two chords \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect within a circle when four points \( A, B, C, D \) are chosen randomly and independently on its circumference.

We can use geometric properties involving angles subtended by arcs and chord intersections.

1. Let's consider the circle divided into four equal parts by the points \( A, B, C, D \). Each part corresponds to an angle of \( 90^\circ \) at the center of the circle.
2. For \( AB \) and \( CD \) to intersect, they must span different pairs of these \( 90^\circ \) sectors. This means one pair of sectors must be completely between the other pair.
3. We need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect and divide by the total possible ways to choose 4 points from the circle.

To solve this, we will use combinatorial methods and geometric probabilities.
