PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
The goal is to find the length of a diagonal of a square given that its perimeter equals that of an equilateral triangle with an area of \(16\sqrt{3}\) square centimeters.

1. Let's denote the side length of the square by \(s\) and the side length of the equilateral triangle by \(t\).
2. Since both shapes have equal perimeters, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   4s = 3t
   \]
3. We know the area of the equilateral triangle is \(16\sqrt{3}\):
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} t^2 = 16\sqrt{3}
   \]
4. Solving for \(t\), we get:
   \[
   t^2 = 64 \implies t = 8
   \]
5. Substituting \(t = 8\) into the perimeter equality:
   \[
   4s = 3 \times 8 \implies s = 6
   \]
6. Now, we need to find the length of a diagonal of the square. For a square with side length \(s\), the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
   \[
   d = s\sqrt{2}
   \]
7. Substituting \(s = 6\):
   \[
   d = 6\sqrt{2}
   \]
