PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
The goal is to find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the points of tangency between the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\) and the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\).

We start by finding the equations of the tangent lines to both curves at their points of intersection.

For the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\):
\[ \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 \]
where \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \sqrt{2}\).

For the parabola \(y^2 = 8x\):
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{4}{y} \]

Let's denote the points of tangency on the circle as \((x_1, y_1)\) and on the parabola as \((x_2, y_2)\).

The slope of the tangent line to the circle at \((x_1, y_1)\) is given by:
\[ m_{circle} = -\frac{x_1}{y_1} \]

The slope of the tangent line to the parabola at \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[ m_{parabola} = \frac{4}{y_2} \]

Since these slopes are equal at the point of tangency, we set them equal to each other:
\[ -\frac{x_1}{y_1} = \frac{4}{y_2} \]

From the equation of the circle, we know:
\[ y_1^2 = 8x_1 \implies y_1 = \pm \sqrt{8x_1} \]

Substituting into the slope equality:
\[ -\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{8x_1}} = \frac{4}{y_2} \implies -\frac{\sqrt{8x_1}}{8} = \frac{4}{y_2} \implies y_2 = \frac{32}{\sqrt{8x_1}} \]

Similarly, from the equation of the parabola:
\[ y_2^2 = 8x_2 \implies y_2 = \pm \sqrt{8x_2} \]

Substituting into the slope equality:
\[ -\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{8x_1}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{8x_2}} \implies -\frac{\sqrt{8x_1}}{8} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{8x_2}} \implies \sqrt{8x_2} = \frac{32}{\sqrt{8x_1}} \implies x_2 = \frac{64}{8\sqrt{8x_1}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{8x_1}} \]

Now, substituting back into the expressions for \(y_1\) and \(y_2\):
\[ y_1 = \pm \sqrt{8 \cdot \frac{8}{\sqrt{8x_1}}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{64}{\sqrt{8x_1}}} = \pm \frac{8}{\sqrt[4]{8x_1}} \]
\[ y_2 = \pm \sqrt{8 \cdot \frac{8}{\sqrt{8x_1}}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac
