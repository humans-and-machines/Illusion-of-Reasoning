Problem/Clue (if available):
In a convex quadrilateral, the measure of the largest angle is twice the measure of the smallest angle, and the other two angles are both right angles. How many degrees are in the largest angle?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
The goal is to find the measure of the largest angle in a convex quadrilateral where the largest angle is twice the smallest angle, and the other two angles are right angles.

Let's denote the measures of the angles as follows:
- Let \( x \) be the measure of the smallest angle.
- Then the largest angle will be \( 2x \).
- Since the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360°, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + x + 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 360^\circ \]

Simplifying this equation gives us:

\[ 2x + 180^\circ = 360^\circ \]
