Problem/Clue (if available):
If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\gcd(a,b)=210$, $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, and $a<b$, how many possible values are there for $a$?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
The goal is to find the number of possible values for \(a\) given that \(\gcd(a,b) = 210\), \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 210^3\), and \(a < b\).

We know from properties of gcd and lcm that:
\[ \gcd(a,b) \times \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab \]

Given \(\gcd(a,b) = 210\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 210^3\), we can substitute these into the equation:
\[ 210 \times 210^3 = ab \]
\[ ab = 210^4 \]

Since \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime (\(\gcd(a,b) = 210\)), both \(a\) and \(b\) must be multiples of 210. Let's express \(a\) and \(b\) as:
\[ a = 210k \]
\[ b = 210m \]
where \(k\) and \(m\) are coprime integers because \(\gcd(k,m) = 1\).

Substituting these into the product equation gives:
\[ 210k \times 210m = 210^4 \]
\[ k \times m = 210^3 \]

Now, we need to count the number of pairs \((k,m)\) where \(k\) and \(m\) are coprime and their product equals \(210^3\). Since \(210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7\), we consider the prime factors separately:

- For the power of 2: \(k\) must include at least one factor of 2, so \(k\) could be \(2^x\) where \(x \geq 1\).
- For the power of 3: \(k\) must include at least one factor of 3, so \(k\) could be \(3^y\) where \(y \geq 1\).
- For the power of 5: \(k\) must include at least one factor of 5, so \(k\) could be \(5^z\) where \(z \geq 1\).
- For the power of 7: \(k\) must include at least one factor of 7, so \(k\) could be \(7^w\) where \(w \geq 1\).

Thus, \(k\) has the form \(2^x \times 3^y \times 5^z \times 7^w\) where \(x, y, z, w \geq 1\).

Similarly, \(m\) will also have the same form since they are coprime and their product is \(210^3\).

To ensure \(k\) and \(m\) are coprime, none of them should share any common prime factors other than those already included in the other. Therefore, we only need to choose distinct powers of 2, 3, 5, and 7 for \(k\) and \(m\).

For each choice of \(x, y, z, w\):
- There are 4 choices for \(x\) (since \(x \geq 1\)).
- There are 4 choices for \(y\) (since \(y \geq 1\)).
- There are 4 choices for \(z
