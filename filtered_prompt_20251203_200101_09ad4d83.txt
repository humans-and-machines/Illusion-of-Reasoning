Problem/Clue (if available):
If
\[f(n + 1) = (-1)^{n + 1} n - 2f(n)\]for $n \ge 1,$ and $f(1) = f(1986),$ compute
\[f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + \dots + f(1985).\]

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
The goal is to find the sum \( f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + \dots + f(1985) \) given the recurrence relation \( f(n+1) = (-1)^{n+1} n - 2f(n) \) and the condition \( f(1) = f(1986) \).

First, we need to determine if there's any pattern or simplification possible from the initial terms. Let's calculate the first few values:

For \( n = 1 \):
\[ f(2) = (-1)^2 \cdot 1 - 2f(1) = 1 - 2f(1) \]

For \( n = 2 \):
\[ f(3) = (-1)^3 \cdot 2 - 2f(2) = -2 - 2(1 - 2f(1)) = -2 - 2 - 4f(1) = -4 - 4f(1) \]

For \( n = 3 \):
\[ f(4) = (-1)^4 \cdot 3 - 2f(3) = 3 - 2(-4 - 4f(1)) = 3 + 8 + 8f(1) = 11 + 8f(1) \]

We observe that the sequence alternates between positive and negative terms, and the coefficients seem to follow a pattern involving \( f(1) \).

Given \( f(1) = f(1986) \), let's denote \( f(1) = c \). Then,
\[ f(1986) = c \]
and since \( f(1986) = f(1) \),
\[ c = c \]
which implies \( f(1) = c \).

Now, we can express the sum \( S = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + \dots + f(1985) \) using the recurrence relation:
\[ S = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + \dots + f(1985) \]
\[ S = f(1) + [(-1)^2 \cdot 1 - 2f(1)] + [(-1)^3 \cdot 2 - 2f(2)] + \dots + [(-1)^{1985} \cdot 1985 - 2f(1984)] \]

Notice that the terms alternate in sign, so we can pair them up:
\[ S = (f(1) - 2f(1)) + ((-1)^2 \cdot 1 - 2f(1)) + ((-1)^3 \cdot 2 - 2f(2)) + \dots + ((-1)^{1985} \cdot 1985 - 2f(1984)) \]
\[ S = (1 - 2c) + (1 - 2c) + (2 - 2f(2)) + \dots + (1985 - 2c) \]

Each pair sums to zero except for the last term:
\[ S = (1 - 2c) + (1 - 2c) + \dots + (1 - 2c) + (1985 - 2c) \]
Since there are 992 pairs, their total sum is zero:
