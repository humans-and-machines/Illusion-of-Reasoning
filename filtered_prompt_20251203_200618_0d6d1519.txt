Problem/Clue (if available):
Find the product of the $y$-coordinates of all the distinct solutions $(x,y)$ for the two equations $y=x^2-8$ and $y^2=-5x+44$.

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
The goal is to find the product of the y-coordinates of all distinct solutions \((x, y)\) for the given system of equations \(y = x^2 - 8\) and \(y^2 = -5x + 44\).

First, substitute \(y = x^2 - 8\) into the second equation:

\[ (x^2 - 8)^2 = -5x + 44 \]

Expand and simplify:

\[ x^4 - 16x^2 + 64 = -5x + 44 \]
\[ x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = 0 \]

This is a quartic equation. To solve it, we can try factoring or using numerical methods. However, let's first check if there are any obvious rational roots by applying the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 20 divided by factors of 1, which gives us ±1, ±2, ±4, ±5, ±10, ±20.

Testing these values, we find that \(x = -2\) is a root:

\[ (-2)^4 - 16(-2)^2 + 5(-2) + 20 = 16 - 64 - 10 + 20 = 0 \]

So, \(x = -2\) is a root. We can use synthetic division to factor the polynomial:

Dividing \(x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20\) by \(x + 2\):

```
   |  1   0   -16  0   5   20
     |        -2   32  -56  -20
-------------------------
      1   -2   -16  32  -21
```

The quotient is \(x^3 - 2x^2 - 16x + 10\), so we have:

\[ x^4 - 16x^2 + 5x + 20 = (x + 2)(x^3 - 2x^2 - 16x + 10) \]

Next, we need to find the roots of the cubic polynomial \(x^3 - 2x^2 - 16x + 10\). Again, testing possible rational roots, we find that \(x = -2\) is not a root, but \(x = 1\) is:

\[ 1^3 - 2(1)^2 - 16(1) + 10 = 1 - 2 - 16 + 10 = -7 \neq 0 \]

We continue testing other rational roots, finding none. Using numerical methods or graphing, we find one real root approximately at \(x \approx 3.93\). For simplicity, let's denote this root as \(r_1\).

Now, substituting back into \(y = x^2 - 8\):

For \(x = r_1\):
\[ y = r_1^2 - 8 \]

Since \(r_1\) is irrational, \(r_1^2\) will also be irrational, making \(y\) irrational. Therefore, the only rational \(y\)-coordinate from the quadratic part is when \(x = -2\):

\[ y = (-2)^2 - 8 = 4 - 8 = -4 \
