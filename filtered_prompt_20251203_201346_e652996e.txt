Problem/Clue (if available):
At 50 miles per hour, how far would a car travel in $2\frac{3}{4}$ hours? Express your answer as a mixed number.

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
Hold on, this reasoning might be wrong. Let's go back and check each step carefully. 1. The goal is to find the distance traveled by a car at 50 miles per hour for \(2\frac{3}{4}\) hours. We can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given speed is 50 miles per hour and time is \(2\frac{3}{4}\) hours, we first convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:

\[ 2\frac{3}{4} = \frac{8}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{11}{4} \]

Now, substitute the values into the distance formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = 50 \times \frac{11}{4} \]

Perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{50 \times 11}{4} = \frac{550}{4} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{550 \div 2}{4 \div 2} = \frac{275}{2} \]

Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:

\[ \frac{275}{2} = 137\frac{1}{2} \]

So, the distance traveled is \(137\frac{1}{2}\) miles.
