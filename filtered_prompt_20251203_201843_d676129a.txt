Problem/Clue (if available):
How many zeroes are at the end of $42!$ (42 factorial)?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\cdot 4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot 1= 120$.)

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
Hold on, this reasoning might be wrong. Let's go back and check each step carefully. 1. Identify the number of factors of 5 in $42!$: 
   - Count multiples of 5 within the range [1, 42]: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8$
   - Count multiples of 25 within the range [1, 42]: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1$
   - Count multiples of 125 within the range [1, 42]: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0$

Adding these up gives us the total number of factors of 5 in $42!$: $8 + 1 + 0 = 9$.

Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in $42!$ is 9.

This seems like a reasonable calculation, so let's double-check our understanding of the concept of trailing zeroes in factorials.

Trailing zeroes in a factorial are determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since 10 can be factored into 2 and 5, and there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, we focus on counting the factors of 5.

The formula to find the number of trailing zeroes in $n!$ is given by:
\[ z(n) = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots \]

Let's verify this using Python code to ensure accuracy.
