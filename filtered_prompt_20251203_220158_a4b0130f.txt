Problem/Clue (if available):
How many zeroes are at the end of $42!$ (42 factorial)?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\cdot 4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot 1= 120$.)

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
Hold on, this reasoning might be wrong. Let's go back and check each step carefully. 1. Identify the number of factors of 5 in $42!$: 
   - Count multiples of 5 within the range [1, 42]: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8$
   - Count multiples of 25 within the range [1, 42]: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1$
   - Count multiples of 125 within the range [1, 42]: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0$

Adding these up gives us the total number of factors of 5 in $42!$: $8 + 1 + 0 = 9$.

Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in $42!$ is 9.

This seems like a reasonable calculation based on the given information. However, let me recheck my understanding of the problem statement and ensure I'm interpreting it correctly.

The problem asks for the number of trailing zeroes in $42!$, which means we're looking for the highest power of 10 that divides $42!$. Since $10 = 2 \times 5$, we need to find the limiting factor between the powers of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of $42!$.

Given that there are typically more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, we should focus on finding the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the prime factorization of $42!$.

Let's recalculate:

- Counting multiples of 5: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8$
- Counting multiples of 25: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1$
- Counting multiples of 125: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0$

Total number of factors of 5 in $42!$: $8 + 1 + 0 = 9$.

Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in $42!$ is indeed 9.

My initial concern was valid, and upon closer inspection, the method used to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in $42!$ is correct. The number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the prime factorization of $42!$, which is 9.

Thus, the number of trailing zeroes in $42!$ is 9.

Thank you for catching my mistake earlier. It's important to double-check our calculations when dealing with such problems.
