Problem/Clue (if available):
How many zeroes are at the end of $42!$ (42 factorial)?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\cdot 4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot 1= 120$.)

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
Hold on, this reasoning might be wrong. Let's go back and check each step carefully. 1. Identify the number of factors of 5 in $42!$: 
   - Count multiples of 5 within the range [1, 42]: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8$
   - Count multiples of 25 within the range [1, 42]: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1$
   - Count multiples of 125 within the range [1, 42]: $\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0$

Adding these up gives us the total number of factors of 5 in $42!$: $8 + 1 + 0 = 9$.

Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in $42!$ is 9.

This seems correct based on my previous analysis. However, let me recheck the logic:

- We counted the multiples of 5 because they contribute directly to the formation of 10s.
- Multiples of 25 contribute two factors of 5 each (since $25 = 5^2$), so we add one extra factor of 5 for each multiple of 25.
- Multiples of 125 do not contribute any additional factors of 5 since $125 > 42$.

So, the calculation is indeed correct. There should be 9 trailing zeroes in $42!$.

Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in $42!$ is 9.

The initial reasoning was sound, and I stand by my conclusion.
