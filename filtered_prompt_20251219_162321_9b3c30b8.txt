Problem/Clue (if available):
What is the range of the function $y=\log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x})$ for $0^\circ< x < 180^\circ$?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The problem asks for the range of the function $y=\log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x})$ for $0^\circ< x < 180^\circ$. The goal is to find the set of possible values of $y$.
2. The givens are the domain $0^\circ< x < 180^\circ$, and the function $y=\log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x})$.
3. To find the range, we need to consider the possible values of $\sin x$ and then apply the logarithm function.
4. Since $0^\circ< x < 180^\circ$, we know that $0 < \sin x < 1$.
5. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $0 < \sqrt{\sin x} < 1$.
6. Since $\log_2$ is a strictly increasing function, we can apply it to both sides of the inequality: $-\infty < \log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x}) < 0$.
7. Therefore, the range of the function $y=\log_2 (\sqrt{\sin x})$ for $0^\circ< x < 180^\circ$ is $(-\infty, 0)$.
