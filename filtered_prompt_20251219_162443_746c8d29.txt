Problem/Clue (if available):
Let $p(x)$ be a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients which has $4-\sqrt{11}$ as a root. Compute $\frac{p(3)}{p(4)}.$

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
Given that $p(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients and has $4-\sqrt{11}$ as a root, we know that its conjugate $4+\sqrt{11}$ is also a root. This is because the coefficients of a polynomial with real coefficients are the same when the roots are a conjugate pair. 
Let the quadratic polynomial be $p(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$ where $r_1 = 4 - \sqrt{11}$ and $r_2 = 4 + \sqrt{11}$.
Using the fact that the product of the roots of a quadratic polynomial is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient, we have $r_1r_2 = \frac{c}{a} = 4^2 - (\sqrt{11})^2 = 16 - 11 = 5.$
The sum of the roots is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the linear term divided by the leading coefficient, so $r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a}.$
We can use the fact that $r_1r_2 = 5$ and $r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a}$ to find the value of $b$ in terms of $a$. We have $(r_1 + r_2)^2 = r_1^2 + 2r_1r_2 + r_2^2 = r_1^2 + 2(5) + r_2^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 = \left(-\frac{b}{a}\right)^2.$
Expanding the left-hand side, we get $r_1^2 + 2r_1r_2 + r_2^2 = (4-\sqrt{11})^2 + 2(5) + (4+\sqrt{11})^2 = 16 - 8\sqrt{11} + 11 + 10 + 16 + 8\sqrt{11} = 53.$
We also have $(r_1 + r_2)^2 = \left(-\frac{b}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2}{a^2}.$
Equating the two expressions for $(r_1 + r_2)^2$, we have $\frac{b^2}{a^2} = 53.$
We can now find the value of $p(3)$ and $p(4)$.
We have $p(3) = a(3 - r_1)(3 - r_2) = a(3 - (4 - \sqrt{11}))(3 - (4 + \sqrt{11})) = a(3 - 4 + \sqrt{11})(3 - 4 - \sqrt{11}) = a(-1 + \sqrt{11})(-1 - \sqrt{11}) = a(1 - 11) = -10a.$
Similarly, we have $p(4) = a(4 - r_1)(4 - r_2) = a(4 - (4 - \sqrt{11}))(4 - (4 + \sqrt{11})) = a(4 - 4 + \sqrt{11})(4 - 4 - \sqrt{11}) = a(\sqrt{11})(-\sqrt{11}) = -11a.$
Therefore, $\frac{p(3)}{p(4)} = \frac{-10
