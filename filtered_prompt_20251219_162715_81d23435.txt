Problem/Clue (if available):
In 1992, a scoop of gelato could be purchased in Italy for 1200 lire. The same gelato would have cost $\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. quote the relevant bits of the problem
We know that 1200 lire is equivalent to \$1.50, and we want to find the exchange rate and then the value of 1,000,000 lire in dollars.
2. name the mathematical tool(s) we apply
We will apply the concept of proportions, as we have a known ratio between lire and dollars.
3. show each intermediate step until the result is reached
Let x be the value of 1,000,000 lire in dollars.
We can set up a proportion: 1200 lire / \$1.50 = 1,000,000 lire / x
We can then cross-multiply and solve for x: 1200x = 1,500,000
Dividing both sides by 1200, we get x = 1,250.
