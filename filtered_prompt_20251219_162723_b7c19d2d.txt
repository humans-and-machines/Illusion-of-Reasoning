Problem/Clue (if available):
In the diagram, $PT$ is parallel to $QR.$ What is the measure of $\angle PQR$ in degrees?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The diagram shows that $PT$ is parallel to $QR$.
2. We can apply the properties of parallel lines and transversals to find the measure of $\angle PQR$.
3. Since $PT$ is parallel to $QR$, we know that $\angle PQT$ and $\angle PQR$ are corresponding angles, so they are congruent.
4. We also know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$, so we can use this fact to find the measure of $\angle PQR$.
5. Let's denote the measure of $\angle PQR$ as $x^\circ$. Then, the measure of $\angle PQT$ is also $x^\circ$.
6. The measure of $\angle QRT$ is $128^\circ$, and the measure of $\angle QPR$ is $2x^\circ$.
7. We can write the equation: $x^\circ + 2x^\circ + 128^\circ = 180^\circ$.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get $3x^\circ + 128^\circ = 180^\circ$.
9. Subtracting $128^\circ$ from both sides, we get $3x^\circ = 52^\circ$.
10. Dividing both sides by $3$, we get $x^\circ = \frac{52^\circ}{3}$.
11. Therefore, the measure of $\angle PQR$ is $\frac{52^\circ}{3}$.
