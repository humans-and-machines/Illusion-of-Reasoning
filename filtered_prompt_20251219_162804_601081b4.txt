Problem/Clue (if available):
What is the domain of the function $f(x) = \frac{2-x}{\log(2-\log(x-2))}$, where $\log$ is the base $10$ logarithm function? Express your answer in interval notation.

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The function $f(x) = \frac{2-x}{\log(2-\log(x-2))}$ has a denominator that cannot be zero, so we must have $2-\log(x-2) \neq 0$. 
2. We will apply properties of logarithms and inequalities to find the domain.
3. First, we solve the inequality $2-\log(x-2) \neq 0$.
4. We can rewrite the inequality as $\log(x-2) \neq 2$.
5. Since the base of the logarithm is 10, we can rewrite the inequality as $x-2 \neq 10^2$.
6. Solving for x, we get $x \neq 102$.
7. We also need to consider the domain of the logarithm function, which requires that $x-2 > 0$.
8. Solving for x, we get $x > 2$.
9. Therefore, the domain of the function is $x \in (2, 102)$.
