Problem/Clue (if available):
There are an infinite number of vectors $\mathbf{v}$ such that
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}.\]Find the vector $\mathbf{v}$ that has the smallest magnitude.

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The problem involves a vector equation involving a cross product, so we need to find a vector $\mathbf{v}$ such that the cross product of $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ equals $\begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}$.
2. To solve this, we can use the property of the cross product that $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{0}$ if and only if $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are parallel or proportional. However, since the right-hand side is not the zero vector, we cannot have $\mathbf{v}$ be a scalar multiple of the left-hand side.
3. Instead, we can use the fact that the cross product is distributive, so we can write the equation as
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}.\]
4. Let $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}$. Then, we have
\[\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & -5 \\ x & y & z \end{vmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}.\]
5. Expanding the determinant, we get
\[\mathbf{i}(2z + 5y) - \mathbf{j}(z + 5x) + \mathbf{k}(y - 2x) = \begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}.\]
6. Equating the components, we get the system of equations
\begin{align*}
2z + 5y &= 90, \\
z + 5x &= -30, \\
y - 2x &= 30.
\end{align*}
7. Solving the second equation for $z$, we get $z = -5x - 30$.
8. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $2(-5x - 30) + 5y = 90$, which simplifies to $-10x + 5y = 150$.
9. Solving the third equation for $y$, we get $y = 2x + 30$.
10. Substituting this into the equation $-10x + 5y = 150$, we get $-10x + 5(2x + 30) = 150$, which simplifies to $-10x + 10x + 150 = 150$, so $150 = 150$.
11. This is a contradiction, so the system of equations has no solution.
12. However, we can still find the vector $\mathbf{v}$ that has the smallest magnitude. Since the system of equations has no solution, the vector $\mathbf{v}$ must be a scalar multiple of the vector $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}$.
13. Let $\mathbf{v} = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end
