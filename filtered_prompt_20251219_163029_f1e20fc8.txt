Problem/Clue (if available):
The superfactorial $n\$$ is defined as $n\$ = \underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}$. What is the units digit of $4\$$?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The problem asks for the units digit of $4\$$, which is defined as $4\$$ = \underbrace{ 4!^{{4!}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{4!}}}}}}_{4!}$.
2. To find the units digit, we can focus on the last digit of the expression. We will apply modular arithmetic and properties of factorials.
3. We know that $4! = 24$, which has a units digit of 4.
4. We can rewrite $4\$$ as $4\$$ = \underbrace{ 4^{{4}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{4}}}}}_{4}$.
5. Now, we need to find the units digit of $4^4$, which is $4^4 = 256$. The units digit is 6.
6. Since $4\$$ is a tower of 4's, we can raise 4 to the power of the result from step 5: $4\$$ = \underbrace{ 4^{{4}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{6}}}}}_{4}$.
7. We need to find the units digit of $4^6$, which is $4^6 = 4096$. The units digit is 6.
8. We can see that the units digit of $4\$$ is 6, because the units digit of $4^6$ is 6.
