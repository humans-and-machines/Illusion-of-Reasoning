Problem/Clue (if available):
The volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. The area of the base of a cone is 30 square units, and its height is 6.5 units. What is the number of cubic units in its volume?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The problem is asking for the volume of a cone with a base area of 30 square units and a height of 6.5 units.
2. The formula for the volume of a cone is given by $V = \frac{1}{3}Bh$.
3. We can substitute the given values of $B$ and $h$ into the formula to find the volume.
4. Using the formula, we get $V = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 30 \cdot 6.5$.
5. Multiplying the numbers, we get $V = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 195$.
6. Simplifying the expression, we get $V = 65$.
