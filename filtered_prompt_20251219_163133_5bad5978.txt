Problem/Clue (if available):
If $\sqrt{3x-5}=2$, find all possible values of $x$.

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The problem is to find all possible values of $x$ given the equation $\sqrt{3x-5}=2$.
2. To solve this, we will use algebraic manipulation and the properties of square roots.
3. Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root: $(\sqrt{3x-5})^2=2^2$
4. Simplify the equation: $3x-5=4$
5. Add 5 to both sides of the equation: $3x=9$
6. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: $x=3$
7. Check that the solution satisfies the original equation: $\sqrt{3(3)-5}=\sqrt{4}=2$
