PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
Given the polynomial equation $x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0$,
we want to find all integer roots.
By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of the constant term $-14$.
The divisors of $-14$ are $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 7, \pm 14$.
We will test these values for $x$ in the polynomial.
Let's start with $x = -1$:
\[(-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14 = -8 \neq 0.\]
Next, let's try $x = 1$:
\[1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0.\]
Since $x = 1$ is a root, we can factor out $(x - 1)$ from the polynomial:
\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14).\]
Now, we need to find the roots of the cubic polynomial $x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14$.
Let's try $x = -2$:
\[(-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 + 15(-2) + 14 = -8 + 24 - 30 + 14 = 0.\]
Since $x = -2$ is a root, we can factor out $(x + 2)$ from the cubic polynomial:
\[x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 = (x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7).\]
Now, we need to find the roots of the quadratic polynomial $x^2 + 4x + 7$.
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
\[x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(7)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 28}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-12}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 2i\sqrt{3}}{2} = -2 \pm i\sqrt{3}.\]
Since we are looking for integer roots, we can ignore the complex roots.
Therefore, the integer roots of the polynomial are $x = \boxed{1, -2}$.
