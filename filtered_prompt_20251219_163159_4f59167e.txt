Problem/Clue (if available):
In $\triangle{RST}$, shown, $\sin{R}=\frac{2}{5}$.  What is $\sin{T}$?

[asy]
pair R,S,T;
T = (0,0);
S = (2,0);
R = (2,sqrt(21));
draw(R--S--T--R);
draw(rightanglemark(R,S,T,10));
label("$T$",T,SW);
label("$S$",S,SE);
label("$R$",R,NE);
label("$5$",(R+T)/2,NW);

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The problem involves a right triangle $RST$ with $\sin{R}=\frac{2}{5}$ and we need to find $\sin{T}$.
2. We can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle, which is $\sin{\theta}=\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$.
3. In this case, $\sin{R}=\frac{2}{5}$ means that the side opposite to angle $R$ is $2$ and the hypotenuse is $5$.
4. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side $RS$. $RS^2 + TS^2 = RT^2$, where $RT=5$ and $TS=2$. Solving for $RS$, we have $RS^2 = RT^2 - TS^2 = 5^2 - 2^2 = 25 - 4 = 21$. Therefore, $RS = \sqrt{21}$.
5. Now, we can use the definition of the sine function to find $\sin{T}$. $\sin{T}=\frac{TS}{RT}=\frac{2}{5}$.
6. However, we need to consider the quadrant of angle $T$. Since $T$ is an acute angle, $\sin{T}$ is positive.
7. Therefore, $\sin{T}=\frac{2}{5}$.
