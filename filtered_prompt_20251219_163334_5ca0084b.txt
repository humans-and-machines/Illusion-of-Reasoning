Problem/Clue (if available):
Let $p(x)$ be a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients which has $4-\sqrt{11}$ as a root. Compute $\frac{p(3)}{p(4)}.$

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
Given that $p(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients and has $4-\sqrt{11}$ as a root, we know that its conjugate $4+\sqrt{11}$ must also be a root. This is because the coefficients of the polynomial are real, and irrational roots of polynomials with real coefficients always come in conjugate pairs.
We can use this information to write the quadratic polynomial as $p(x) = a(x-(4-\sqrt{11}))(x-(4+\sqrt{11}))$ for some integer $a$. Expanding this expression, we get $p(x) = a(x^2-8x+3)$.
We can now evaluate $p(3)$ and $p(4)$: $p(3) = a(3^2-8\cdot 3+3) = a(9-24+3) = -12a$ and $p(4) = a(4^2-8\cdot 4+3) = a(16-32+3) = -13a$.
We can now compute $\frac{p(3)}{p(4)} = \frac{-12a}{-13a} = \frac{12}{13}$.
