\[\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.\]

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. We are given the inequality \[\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.\]
2. To solve this inequality, we will use the properties of absolute value and algebraic manipulation.
3. First, we note that $x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9)$ and $x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)$.
4. We can rewrite the inequality as \[\left|\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\right| < 0.\]
5. For the absolute value of a fraction to be negative, the fraction must be negative.
6. So, we can rewrite the inequality as \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
7. We can factor the numerator as $(x-9)(x+9) = x^2 - 81$.
8. We can rewrite the inequality as \[\frac{x^2 - 81}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
9. We can factor the numerator as $(x-9)(x+9)$.
10. We can rewrite the inequality as \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
11. We can use the sign table method to determine the intervals where the inequality is true.
12. We create a sign table with the critical points $x = 0, 9, 36$.
13. We evaluate the sign of the expression $(x-9)(x+9)/[x(x-36)]$ in each interval defined by the critical points.
14. The intervals are $(-\infty, 0)$, $(0, 9)$, $(9, 36)$, and $(36, \infty)$.
15. We can determine the sign of the expression in each interval by choosing a test point in each interval and evaluating the expression at that point.
16. The intervals where the expression is negative are $(0, 9)$ and $(36, \infty)$.
17. However, we must exclude the point $x = 9$ because it makes the denominator zero.
18. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $(0, 9) \cup (36, \infty)$.
