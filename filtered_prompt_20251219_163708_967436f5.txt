Problem/Clue (if available):
Find the maximum value of
\[f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2},\]where $-1 \le x,$ $y \le 1.$

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The problem asks for the maximum value of the function f(x,y) = x sqrt(1 - y^2) + y sqrt(1 - x^2), where -1 <= x, y <= 1.
2. We can use the AM-GM inequality to solve this problem.
3. By AM-GM, we have:
\[x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \le \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2} + \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2} = x^2 + y^2.\]
4. To find the maximum value of f(x,y), we need to maximize x^2 + y^2.
5. Since -1 <= x, y <= 1, the maximum value of x^2 + y^2 occurs when x = y = 1 or x = y = -1.
6. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x,y) is x^2 + y^2 when x = y = 1 or x = y = -1.
7. Plugging in x = y = 1, we get f(1,1) = 1*sqrt(1-1^2) + 1*sqrt(1-1^2) = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 =
