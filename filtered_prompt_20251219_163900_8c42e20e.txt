Problem/Clue (if available):
Convert $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ to a terminating decimal.

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. We are given the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ and we want to convert it to a terminating decimal.
2. The mathematical tool we will apply is to manipulate the denominator to be in the form $10^n$.
3. The denominator can be rewritten as $2^2 \cdot 5^7 = (2^2 \cdot 5^1)^3 \cdot 5^4 = 10^3 \cdot 5^4$.
4. Now we can rewrite the fraction as $\frac{21}{10^3 \cdot 5^4}$.
5. Since $5^4 = 625 = 10^2 \cdot 25$, we can rewrite the fraction as $\frac{21}{10^3 \cdot 10^2 \cdot 25} = \frac{21}{10^5 \cdot 25}$.
6. Now we can rewrite 25 as $5^2$, so the fraction becomes $\frac{21}{10^5 \cdot 5^2}$.
7. To get the denominator to be in the form $10^n$, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by $2^2$, which is 4.
8. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 4 gives $\frac{21 \cdot 4}{10^5 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 4} = \frac{84}{10^5 \cdot 25}$.
9. Now we can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.
10. Dividing the numerator and denominator by 4 gives $\frac{21}{10^5 \cdot 25/4}$.
11. Simplifying the denominator gives $\frac{21}{10^5 \cdot 25/4} = \frac{21}{2.5 \cdot 10^5}$.
12. Converting 2.5 to a fraction gives $\frac{21}{10/4 \cdot 10^5} = \frac{21}{10/4 \cdot 10^5}$.
13. Simplifying the denominator gives $\frac{21}{2.5 \cdot 10^5} = \frac{84}{10^5 \cdot 4}$.
14. Therefore, the fraction can be rewritten as $\frac{21}{10^5} \cdot \frac{4}{25}$.
15. Now we can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.
16. Dividing the numerator and denominator by 1 gives $\frac{21}{10^5} \cdot \frac{4}{25}$.
17. Now we can evaluate the expression $\frac{21}{10^5} \cdot \frac{4}{25}$.
18. Evaluating the expression gives $\frac{21}{100000} \cdot \frac{4}{25}$.
19. Multiplying the numerators and denominators gives $\frac{21 \cdot 4}{100000 \cdot 25}$.
20. Evaluating the numerator and denominator gives $\frac{84}{2500000}$.
21. Therefore, the terminating decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ is $\frac{84}{2500000}$.
