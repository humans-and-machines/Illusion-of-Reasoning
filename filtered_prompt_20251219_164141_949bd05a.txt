\[Ax + By + Cz + D = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D$ are integers such that $A > 0$ and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1.$

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
Given three points $(x_1,y_1,z_1),$ $(x_2,y_2,z_2),$ and $(x_3,y_3,z_3),$ the equation of the plane containing them can be found by taking the cross product of the vectors $\vec{PQ} = \langle x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1,z_2-z_1 \rangle$ and $\vec{PR} = \langle x_3-x_1,y_3-y_1,z_3-z_1 \rangle$ and then setting the dot product of the resulting vector with $\vec{P} = \langle x_1,y_1,z_1 \rangle$ equal to zero.
We have the points $(0,-1,-1),$ $(-4,4,4),$ and $(4,5,1).$  We will use the cross product to find the equation of the plane containing these points.
Let $\vec{PQ} = \langle -4-0,4-(-1),4-(-1) \rangle = \langle -4,5,5 \rangle$ and $\vec{PR} = \langle 4-0,5-(-1),1-(-1) \rangle = \langle 4,6,2 \rangle.$
The cross product of $\vec{PQ}$ and $\vec{PR}$ is
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
-4 & 5 & 5 \\
4 & 6 & 2
\end{vmatrix} &= (5\cdot2-5\cdot6)\mathbf{i} - (-4\cdot2-5\cdot4)\mathbf{j} + (-4\cdot6-5\cdot4)\mathbf{k} \\
&= (-20-30)\mathbf{i} - (-8-20)\mathbf{j} + (-24-20)\mathbf{k} \\
&= -50\mathbf{i} + 28\mathbf{j} - 44\mathbf{k} \\
&= \langle -50,28,-44 \rangle.
\end{align*}
Now we take the dot product of this vector with $\vec{P} = \langle 0,-1,-1 \rangle$ and set it equal to zero:
\begin{align*}
\langle -50,28,-44 \rangle \cdot \langle 0,-1,-1 \rangle &= 0(-50) + (-1)(28) + (-1)(-44) = 0 - 28 + 44 = 16.
\end{align*}
However, we want the equation of the plane to be in the form $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0.$  We can rewrite the equation as $-50x + 28y - 44z + 16 = 0.$  Since $A$ is negative, we multiply both sides of the equation by $-1$ to obtain the desired form:
\begin{align*}
-(-50x + 28y - 44z + 16) &= 0 \\
50x - 28y + 44z - 16 &= 0.
\end{align*}
Since $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = \gcd(50,28,44,16) = 2,$ we can divide both sides of the equation by $2$ to obtain the equation in
