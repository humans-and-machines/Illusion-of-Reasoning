Problem/Clue (if available):
If
\[\sqrt[3]{2} = a + \cfrac{1}{b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}},\]where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ are positive integers, compute $b.$

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
Given the equation $\sqrt[3]{2} = a + \cfrac{1}{b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}}$, we need to find the value of $b.$
We start by letting $x = b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}.$ Then, we can rewrite the equation as $\sqrt[3]{2} = a + \cfrac{1}{x}.$
Multiplying both sides by $x^3$ yields $2x^3 = x^3 + ax^2 + 1.$ Rearranging, we get $x^3 - ax^2 - 2x + 1 = 0.$
We can apply the rational root theorem to find possible rational roots of this equation. The divisors of 1 are $\pm 1,$ and the divisors of 2 are $\pm 1, \pm 2.$ Therefore, the possible rational roots are $\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{1}, \pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{2}{1}, \pm \frac{2}{1}.$
We can try these values for $x$ to find the value of $a.$ We find that $x = 2$ is a root, so we can factor the polynomial as $(x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 1) = 0.$
Since the discriminant of $x^2 + 2x + 1$ is negative, it has no real roots. Therefore, $x = 2$ is the only real root, and we can conclude that $b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}} = 2.$
Now, we can rewrite the original equation as $\sqrt[3]{2} = a + \cfrac{1}{2}.$ Multiplying both sides by 2 yields $2\sqrt[3]{2} = 2a + 1.$
We can cube both sides to get $8\cdot 2 = (2a + 1)^3.$ Expanding the right-hand side, we get $16 = 8a^3 + 12a^2 + 6a + 1.$
Rearranging, we get $8a^3 + 12a^2 + 6a - 15 = 0.$ We can apply the rational root theorem to find possible rational roots of this equation. The divisors of 15 are $\pm 1, \pm 3, \pm 5, \pm 15,$ and the divisors of 8 are $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 8.$ Therefore, the possible rational roots are $\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{4}, \pm \frac{1}{8}, \pm 3, \pm \frac{3}{2}, \pm \frac{3}{4}, \pm \frac{3}{8}, \pm 5, \pm \frac{5}{2}, \pm \frac{5}{4}, \pm \frac{5}{8}, \pm 15, \pm \frac{15}{2}, \pm \frac{15}{4}, \pm \frac{15}{8}.$
