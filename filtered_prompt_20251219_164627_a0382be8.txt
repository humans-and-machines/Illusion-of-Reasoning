Problem/Clue (if available):
Three pencils and a jumbo eraser cost $\$1.24$. Five pencils and a jumbo eraser cost $\$1.82$. No prices include tax. In cents, what is the cost of a pencil?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
Let $p$ be the cost of a pencil and $e$ be the cost of the jumbo eraser. 
The problem states that three pencils and a jumbo eraser cost $\$1.24$ and five pencils and a jumbo eraser cost $\$1.82$. We can write this as a system of linear equations:

$$3p + e = 124$$
$$5p + e = 182$$

We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $e$:

$$(5p + e) - (3p + e) = 182 - 124$$

Using the distributive property, we get:

$$2p = 58$$

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

$$p = 29$$

So the cost of a pencil is $\$0.29$.

The cost of a pencil is 29 cents.
