Problem/Clue (if available):
Let $S$ be the union of the set of all points inside a regular nonagon with side length $2$ units and the set of all points less than $1$ unit away from a point on the perimeter of the nonagon.  What, in units, is the perimeter of $S$?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The problem asks for the perimeter of set $S$, which is the union of points inside a regular nonagon with side length 2 units and points less than 1 unit away from the perimeter of the nonagon.
2. To calculate the perimeter of $S$, we need to find the total length around the boundary of $S$.
3. First, we find the area of the circle with radius 1 centered at a vertex of the nonagon, which is $\pi r^2 = \pi(1)^2 = \pi$.
4. The area of the nonagon can be found using the formula for the area of a regular polygon, which is $A = \frac{n \cdot s^2}{4 \tan(\pi/n)}$. With n=9 and s=2, we get $A = \frac{9 \cdot 2^2}{4 \tan(\pi/9)} = \frac{18}{\tan(\pi/9)}$.
5. The area of the nonagon outside the circle is the area of the nonagon minus the area of the circle, which is $\frac{18}{\tan(\pi/9)} - \pi$.
6. The total area of $S$ is the area of the nonagon plus the area of the nine circles with radius 1 centered at the vertices of the nonagon, which is $\frac{18}{\tan(\pi/9)} + 9\pi$.
7. The total perimeter of $S$ is the perimeter of the nonagon plus the perimeter of the nine circles, which is $9 \cdot 2 + 2 \pi \cdot 1 \cdot 9 = 18 + 18\pi$.
8. However, the problem asks for the perimeter of the set $S$, which includes the inner circles as well. So, we must add the perimeter of the inner circles that are not part of the nonagon.
9. This corresponds to a smaller circle of radius 1 unit and 9 circles of radius 1 unit around each of the 9 vertices of the nonagon, but we need to subtract the 9 sectors of the smaller circle that are inside the nonagon.
10. This can be simplified by realizing that the 9 sectors of the smaller circle are the 9 angles of the nonagon, each with a central angle of $40^\circ$ and an arc length of $\frac{2\pi}{9}$, which is $\frac{2\pi}{9}$.
11. The total length of the 9 sectors is $9 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{9} = 2\pi$.
12. So the total perimeter of $S$ is the perimeter of the nonagon plus the perimeter of the 9 circles plus the perimeter of the 9 sectors, which is $18 + 18\pi + 2\pi = 18 + 20\pi$.
