Problem/Clue (if available):
Determine the modulo 4 remainder of the following sum: $$ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12. $$

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The problem is to find the modulo 4 remainder of the sum of consecutive numbers from 1 to 12.
2. Mathematical tool: modular arithmetic.
3. First, we find the sum of the numbers from 1 to 12:
   The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: $$ S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) $$
   where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.
   In this case, $n = 12$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_n = 12$.
   Therefore, the sum is: $$ S_{12} = \frac{12}{2}(1 + 12) = 6 \cdot 13 = 78. $$
   Now, we need to find the modulo 4 remainder of 78.
   Using the modulo operation, we have: $$ 78 \mod 4 = 2. $$
