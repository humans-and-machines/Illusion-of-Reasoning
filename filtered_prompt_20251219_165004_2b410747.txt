Problem/Clue (if available):
In the diagram, two circles, each with center $D$, have radii of $1$ and $2$. The total area of the shaded region is $\frac5{12}$ of the area of the larger circle. How many degrees are in the measure of (the smaller) $\angle ADC$?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The problem states there are two circles with the same center D, one with a radius of 1 and the other with a radius of 2. The total area of the shaded region is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle.
2. To find the angle $\angle ADC$, we need to use geometry and trigonometry, specifically the concept of sectors and the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.
3. We'll start by finding the area of the shaded region in terms of the area of the larger circle.
4. The area of the larger circle is $\pi r^2 = \pi(2)^2 = 4\pi$.
5. The area of the smaller circle is $\pi r^2 = \pi(1)^2 = \pi$.
6. The shaded region is the difference between the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller circle, minus the area of the small overlapping sector of the larger circle.
7. The area of the small overlapping sector of the larger circle is $\frac{1}{6} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{2\pi}{3}$.
8. So the area of the shaded region is $4\pi - \pi - \frac{2\pi}{3} = \frac{8\pi}{3}$.
9. The problem states that this area is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle, so we can set up the equation $\frac{8\pi}{3} = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi$.
10. We can solve for the unknown angle by finding the measure of the central angle that corresponds to the shaded region.
11. Since the area of the shaded region is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle, the central angle of the sector that contains the shaded region must be $\frac{5}{12}$ of the total angle of the circle, which is $360^\circ$.
12. Therefore, the central angle is $\frac{5}{12} \cdot 360^\circ = 150^\circ$.
13. The inscribed angle $\angle ADC$ is half the measure of the central angle, so $\angle ADC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 150^\circ = 75^\circ$.
14. We can use the law of cosines to find the measure of $\angle ADC$, but since we already have the measure of the central angle, we can simply divide by 2.
15. Therefore, the measure of $\angle ADC$ is $75^\circ$.
