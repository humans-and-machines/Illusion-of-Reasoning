Problem/Clue (if available):
The superfactorial $n\$$ is defined as $n\$ = \underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}$. What is the units digit of $4\$$?

PASS-1 <think> (truncated if long):
1. The superfactorial $n\$ is defined as $n\$ = \underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}$.
2. We need to find the units digit of $4\$, which is equivalent to finding $4\$ \pmod{10}$.
3. Since $4! = 24$, we can start by finding $24^2 = 576$.
4. The units digit of $24^2$ is $6$.
5. Now, we need to find the units digit of $24^{24}$.
6. The units digit of $24^{24}$ is the same as the units digit of $4^{24} \pmod{10}$.
7. By Euler's theorem, we have $4^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$.
8. So, $4^{24} = (4^4)^6 \equiv 1^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$.
9. Therefore, the units digit of $4^{24}$ is $1$.
10. Now, we need to find the units digit of $24^{24}$.
11. The units digit of $24^{24}$ is the same as the units digit of $4^{24} \pmod{10}$, which is $1$.
12. Now, we need to find the units digit of $24^{24} \pmod{10}$.
13. Since the units digit of $24^{24}$ is $1$, the units digit of $24^{24} \pmod{10}$ is also $1$.
14. Therefore, the units digit of $4\$ is $1$.
