\subsection{Qwen-7B and Llama-8B Regressions}
\label{app:qwen-llama}

We extend the main-text analysis to probe the role of model \emph{family} and \emph{size}.
Replicating the raw-effect analyses for \textbf{Qwen2.5-7B} and \textbf{Llama3.1-8B} on \textsc{Math}, we observe the same qualitative pattern reported for \textbf{Qwen2.5-1.5B}: mid-trace reasoning shifts are consistently detrimental across training steps and remain negative across decoding temperatures (magnitudes vary, not the sign), matching Fig.~\ref{fig:raw-effect-overlay} and Table~\ref{tab:rs} in the main text.

We begin by checking whether the core RQ1 finding about \emph{rarity} generalizes across model family and size. Using the same formal detector (Def.~\ref{def:aha-moment-lrms}) and threshold grid as in the main text, we compute the fraction of problem--checkpoint pairs that qualify as ``Aha!'' events. Fig.~\ref{fig:aha-heatmap-overall-7b8b} shows that these events remain extremely sparse for both Qwen2.5--7B and Llama\,3.1--8B (\textsc{Math}, $T{=}0.7$).

  events are exceedingly rare. Per-domain, per temperature breakdowns appear in
  App.~\ref{sec:app-formal-aha-temp}.}

\subsubsection{Step and Temperature Analysis}

We then repeat the regression analysis from Table~\ref{tab:rs} for these models. Estimates in Table~\ref{tab:rs-7b8b} confirm the same direction and significance profile as in the main-text Qwen2.5-1.5B analysis.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty Analysis}
\label{app:uncertainty-analysis}

This appendix extends the main-text uncertainty analysis to larger model families on \textsc{Math}, using traces from \textbf{Qwen2.5-7B} and \textbf{Llama3.1-8B}. Our goal is to test a simple hypothesis: if reasoning shifts are primarily an \emph{uncertainty response} (the model ``notices'' it may be wrong and pivots), then shifts should become \emph{more likely} as uncertainty rises. We operationalize uncertainty using each trace's \emph{sequence-level entropy} (computed from the model's token-level predictive distribution, aggregated to the sequence), and we use the same GPT-derived binary shift indicator as in the main text.

\paragraph{Shift prevalence vs.\ entropy.}
For each decoding temperature $T$, we regress the shift indicator on standardized sequence entropy with problem fixed effects and cluster-robust standard errors clustered by problem. Concretely, letting $\texttt{shift}_{i}$ denote whether trace $i$ contains a GPT-labeled reasoning shift and $\texttt{std\_entropy}_{i}$ denote within-setting standardized sequence entropy, we estimate:
\[
\texttt{shift} \sim \texttt{C(problem)} + \texttt{std\_entropy},
\]
using a Binomial(logit) GLM and cluster-robust SEs (problem-level clustering). Problem fixed effects ensure the entropy association is identified from within-problem variation rather than cross-problem difficulty differences.

Across both model families, we again find a \emph{non-positive} association between entropy and shift prevalence. In particular, at $T{=}0.05$ and $T{=}0.7$, a 1 SD increase in entropy significantly \emph{reduces} the odds of a detected shift (OR$_{1\sigma}{=}{{OR_005}}$, $p={{P_005}}$; OR$_{1\sigma}{=}{{OR_07}}$, $p={{P_07}}$), while the estimates at $T{=}0$ and $T{=}0.3$ are not distinguishable from zero. This pattern mirrors our smaller \textbf{Qwen2.5-1.5B} \textsc{Math} models: shifts are not more common in high-entropy regimes, and when a dependence is detectable, it points in the opposite direction.

\paragraph{Entropy-stratified shift effects on accuracy.}
To complement the prevalence analysis, Table~\ref{tab:shift-entropy-strata-7b8b} stratifies the \emph{raw} shift effect on correctness by entropy: we report the accuracy gap
$\Delta = \hat p(\checkmark\mid S{=}1) - \hat p(\checkmark\mid S{=}0)$
for all traces, for the top-entropy quintile (top 20\%), and for the remaining traces (bottom 80\%), pooling temperatures and restricting to early training steps (steps $\le\!450$). The qualitative picture is consistent across strata: shifts are strongly associated with \emph{lower} accuracy, and the magnitude remains substantially negative even within the high-entropy slice. In other words, the ``shift penalty'' is not confined to low-entropy, overconfident decoding; it persists when the model is most uncertain.

\paragraph{Forced reconsideration as a separate mechanism.}
Finally, Table~\ref{tab:forced-aha-math-7b8b} reports paired sample-level results for \emph{triggered reconsideration} (our forced second pass). This manipulation differs from spontaneous shifts: it explicitly prompts the model to re-evaluate, potentially inducing additional search even when the first pass is confident. We therefore view forced reconsideration as probing a \emph{capability to revise} rather than the natural prevalence of mid-trace pivots. On \textsc{Math}, forced reconsideration yields a clear positive gain for \textbf{Qwen2.5-7B} but not for \textbf{Llama3.1-8B} in this slice, suggesting that ``being prompted to look again'' can help some models, even though naturally occurring reasoning shifts are not enriched at high entropy and are typically associated with worse outcomes.

\subsection{Entropy-Gated Interventions with Multiple Cues}
\label{app:uncertainty-interventions}

To test whether the effect of artificially triggered reflection depends on the specific reconsideration cue used, we evaluate three semantically similar but lexically distinct prompts:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{C1:} ``Hold on, this reasoning might be wrong. Let's go back and check each step carefully.''
    \item \textbf{C2:} ``Actually, this approach doesn't look correct. Let's restart and work through the solution more systematically.''
    \item \textbf{C3:} ``Wait, something is not right; we need to reconsider. Let's think this through step by step.''
\end{itemize}

For each cue, we re-run $8\times$ 500 Math problems (Qwen2.5--1.5B, final checkpoint) with 1-shot decoding at $T{=}0.1$, obtaining $500$ paired baseline and cued completions per cue. We then fit a logistic regression for each cue, controlling for baseline correctness and problem identity.\footnote{In R-style notation:
\(
\texttt{correct} \sim \texttt{entropy\_std} + \texttt{baseline\_correct} + \texttt{C(problem)}.
\)
Here \texttt{entropy\_std} is the within-domain standardized sequence-level entropy defined in \S\ref{ss:unc}.}

Across all cues, higher entropy is strongly associated with improved post-intervention accuracy. Table~\ref{tab:cue-regressions} reports standardized entropy coefficients, unit odds ratios (raw entropy), and odds ratios for a 1 SD increase in entropy.

\label{tab:cue-regressions}
\vspace{-2mm}
\end{table}


All three cues show the same qualitative pattern: a one--standard deviation increase in entropy substantially increases the odds of correctness after the reconsideration cue (2.2$\times$--2.5$\times$ across cues). C2 yields the strongest effect, but the differences are modest, indicating that the intervention's success is tied to \emph{uncertainty} rather than to any particular lexical phrasing. These results demonstrate that entropy-gated reconsideration is robust to cue choice and that induced shifts reliably outperform spontaneous ones under high-uncertainty conditions.

\subsection{Reasoning Shifts at Scale}
\label{app:external-models}

To verify that our findings are not an artifact of the GRPO\textendash tuned models studied in the main paper, we evaluate two widely discussed reasoning models---DeepSeek\textendash R1 and GPT\textendash 4o---under our shift\textendash detection protocol. These models have been cited as exhibiting frequent ``Aha!'' moments or dramatic mid\textendash trace realizations \citep{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability}, making them a natural stress test for our methodology.

\paragraph{Experimental setup.}
We evaluate both models on the full \textsc{MATH\textendash 500} benchmark with:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item 1\textendash shot decoding,
    \item temperatures $T\in\{0, 0.05\}$,
    \item identical prompting format (with \texttt{<think>} and \texttt{<answer>} tags),
    \item no system\textendash level alterations or heuristics.
\end{itemize}
Each model generates exactly one chain\textendash of\textendash thought sample per problem, yielding $N{=}500$ traces per model per temperature.

\paragraph{Shift detection.}
We use the same annotation protocol as in \S\ref{ss:rtc} and App.~\ref{app:detecting-aha}:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Cue prefilter:} at least one explicit lexical cue of reconsideration (e.g., ``wait'', ``actually'', ``hold on''), using the whitelist in Table~\ref{tab:shift-cue-whitelist}.
    \item \textbf{Material revision:} GPT\textendash 4o judges whether the post\textendash cue reasoning constitutes a genuine plan pivot (rejecting a candidate, switching method, resolving a contradiction), returning a strict JSON verdict.
    \item Cases lacking either (A) lexical cue or (B) structural revision are labeled as \textbf{no shift}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Results.}
Table~\ref{tab:external-models} shows shift prevalence and conditional accuracy by decoding temperature. Despite anecdotal impressions of frequent ``Aha!'' behavior, both models exhibit \emph{very low} canonical shift rates under our shift definition.

{{TABLE_EXTERNAL_MODELS}}

At $T{=}0.05$, DeepSeek\textendash R1 exhibits only 2 shifts out of 500 traces; conditional accuracy is $0.50$, but the sample size is too small for meaningful inference. GPT\textendash 4o exhibits more shifts (11/500 at $T{=}0.05$), but conditional correctness among shifted traces is substantially \emph{worse} than its baseline rate (0.18 vs.\ 0.40). At $T{=}0$, GPT\textendash 4o's conditional accuracy among shifted traces is higher (0.60), but the shift base rate remains low (3.0\%), and the direction is not stable across temperatures.

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
These results reinforce two conclusions:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Low base rate of canonical shifts.}
    Even high\textendash capability reasoning models produce genuine, criteria\textendash satisfying mid\textendash trace pivots only rarely.
    \item \textbf{Canonical shifts do not reliably improve accuracy.}
    Conditional accuracy given a shift is unstable across temperatures and does not show a consistent benefit.
\end{enumerate}
Overall, these sanity checks suggest that the rarity and limited utility of detected reasoning shifts are \emph{not} artifacts of model size, training method, or family.

\paragraph{Data release.}
We release the full set of model outputs and shift annotations used in this analysis on Hugging Face, see Table \ref{tab:external-datasets}.
