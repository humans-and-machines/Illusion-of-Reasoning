[2025-10-03 23:48:35,870] [INFO] [real_accelerator.py:219:get_accelerator] Setting ds_accelerator to cuda (auto detect)
Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /n/fs/similarity/open-r1/data/Llama3p1-8B-OpenR1-GRPO-math-20250929_114305/checkpoint-50/.triton, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.
