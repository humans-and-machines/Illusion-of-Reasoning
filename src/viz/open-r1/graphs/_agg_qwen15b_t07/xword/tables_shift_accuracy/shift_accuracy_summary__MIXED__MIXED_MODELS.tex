Table~\ref{tab:shift-accuracy} reports the frequency of detected shifts ($S_{i,j}$) and conditional accuracy with and without a shift. Across domains and models, shifts are rare ($\approx 2.6\%$ of samples overall) and, when they occur, accuracy is lower than in non-shifted traces (10.8\% vs.\ 23.8\% correct; test: logistic GLM with problem fixed effects and cluster-robust SEs, $p<10^{-4}$).
