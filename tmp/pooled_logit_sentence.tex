A pooled logistic regression of correctness on a shift indicator confirms that this difference is highly significant (p $< 10^{-1198}$).\footnote{In R-style notation,
\(
\texttt{correct} \sim \texttt{shift}.
\)
\texttt{correct} is a binary outcome, and \texttt{shift} is a binary indicator for an annotator-labeled reasoning shift. The pooled regression aggregates all test-set traces across Crossword, Math, and RHour.}
